# Functions-Modules_Python



## Overview
This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of functions and modules:

1. **Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function**
2. **Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations**

Each program takes user input, performs computations, and displays the expected output.

---

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
**Filename:** `Task1.py`

### Description
This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function. It takes an integer input from the user, computes the factorial, and displays the result.

### Usage
- Run the script and enter an integer when prompted.
- The program will return and display the factorial of the entered number.

### Example Output
```d
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
**Filename:** `Task2.py`

### Description
This program demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module to perform mathematical calculations. It takes a numerical input from the user and computes:
- The **square root** of the number.
- The **logarithm**.
- The **sine**.

### Usage
- Run the script and enter a number when prompted.
- The program will display the calculated results for square root, logarithm, and sine.

### Example Output
```d
Enter a number: 25
Square root : 5.0
logarithm : 3.2188758248682006
Sine : -0.13235175009777303
```

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
4. Run the programs using the following commands:

   - **For Task 1:**
     ```
     python Task1.py
     ```
   - **For Task 2:**
     ```
     python Task2.py
     ```

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `math` module for Task 2).
